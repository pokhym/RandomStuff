# What's Here
This folder contains proofs and tools that I've written in Maude.
Each folder will contain the code for the system in question and a README discussing the specificaiton.
If there is a paper attached to a specific algorithm it will either be cited in the README or have a pdf in the folder.

# Projects

CoatCheckMate: A system built on top of COATCheck and CheckMate which does automated verification of microarchitectural side channel defenses.
